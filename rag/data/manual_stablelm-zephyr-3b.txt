Question: What should I do if the display does not work?

Answer (step-by-step, with tips and precautions):

1. Ensure that the Gear VR is correctly attached to your mobile device and that the correct mobile device is connected to the Gear VR.

2. Check the brightness settings on both the Gear VR and your mobile device. Make sure the slider is properly positioned (increase brightness or decrease brightness) and that the screen is not tilted or skewed while the Gear VR is being used.
